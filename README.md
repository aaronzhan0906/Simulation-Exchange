## Techniques Highlights

* Built the backend system using **Node.js / Express** as the core framework.
* Utilized **Kafka** as a low-latency message queue for real-time data processing.
* **Python** was employed for the matching engine to handle order matching logic.
* Developed the market-making algorithm using **Node.js** and automated its operation with **PM2**.
* Data is stored in **RDS / MySQL**, normalized to 3NF/2NF, with indexing to enhance query performance and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
* **Redis** is used for storing historical data, real-time data, and order books, optimizing read/write speeds.
* Implemented **WebSocket** with rooms for targeted real-time data and trade result pushing.
* Implemented containerized deployment using **Docker-Compose** and deployed on **EC2**.
* **S3** and **CloudFront** are utilized for image storage and distribution.
* Integrated with the Binance API to retrieve real-time market data and 30 days of historical data.

## Matching Mechanism of Matching Engine
Find the best price, execute the trade if matched, otherwise enter the order book.

## Datastructure of Matching Engine
* **SortedDict**
    * Automatically sorts a dictionary based on price.
    * Retrieve the minimum/maximum price in O(1).
    * Insert, delete, and search operations in O(log n).
* **deque**
    * At each price level, when matching orders, remove from the front; for new orders, add them to the back.
    * Head and tail operations in O(1).
* **index**
    * Uses the order ID as the key.
    * Deletion operation in O(1).

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Get Best Price | O(1) |
| Insert | O(log n) |
| Match | O(n * m) |
| Delete | O(1) |

<sub>n: Number of price levels</sub>
<sub>m: Number of orders at a single price level</sub>
