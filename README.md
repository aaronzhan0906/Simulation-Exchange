## Technique Highlights
* Built the backend system using **Node.js / Express** as the core framework.
* Utilized **Kafka** for real-time data processing with multiple topics for different data streams.
* **Python** was employed for the matching engine to handle order matching logic.
* Developed the market-making strategy using **Node.js** and automated its operation with **PM2**.
* **RDS / MySQL** stores normalized 3NF data. Indexing optimizes queries; foreign keys ensure integrity.
* Utilized **Transaction** and **SELECT ... FOR UPDATE** for concurrency control in data updates.
* **Redis** is used for storing historical data, real-time data, and order books, optimizing read/write speeds.
* Implemented **WebSocket** with rooms for targeted real-time data and trade result pushing.
* Implemented containerized deployment using **Docker Compose** and deployed on **EC2**.
* **S3** and **CloudFront** are utilized for image storage and distribution.
* Uses **JWT** for authentication, with access tokens and refresh tokens for session management.
* Integrated with the Binance API for real-time market data and 30 days of historical data.

## Order Book Mechanism
* Sorted by price
* First-in-first-out within the same price level

## Matching Mechanism of Matching Engine
Find the best price for the new order; execute the trade if matched; otherwise, enter the order into the order book.

## Data Structure of Matching Engine
* **SortedDict**
    * Automatically sorts a dictionary based on price.
    * Retrieve the minimum/maximum price in O(1).
    * Insert, delete, and search operations in O(log n).
* **Dictionary**
    * Since Python version 3.7, dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.   
    * A dict is used for each price level.
    * FIFO (First In, First Out).
<br>

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Get Best Price | O(1) |
| Insert | O(log n) |
| Match | O(n * m) |
| Delete | O(log n) |

<sub>n: Number of price levels</sub>
<br>
<sub>m: Number of orders at a single price level</sub>
